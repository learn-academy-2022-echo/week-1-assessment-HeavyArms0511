# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: 

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git stands for Global Information Tracker and gives you a way to access information remotely or upload remotely to a "hub" of some sort.  Github is a place where you can use git to send files documents and data to a central hub to be accesses.

Git is the tool that lets you move things around such as files and documents and Github is the place to hold said files or to pull files and data from.

Researched answer: Git is an open source code management that helps companies and people track changes in code and actually helps multiple web developers to work on projects together. Git is a way to track changes in your code while Github is a cloud-based service that lets you manage and use git repositories.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: The javascript operators that will return a Boolean value are AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!). 

Researched answer: After reasearching I keep coming up with the same answer that the JavaScript operators that will return a Boolean value are, AND (&&), OR(||), and NOT (!).

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: Index is the location of a value starting from 0.  The difference between an index and a value is that an index is the location of a value while the value is the type of data at that index.

Researched answer: Index is the position of a value in code, and the difference between index and value is that the index is the position at which a specific value is located. 

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: Iteration is doing a certain thing multiple times until it is told to stop.

Researched answer: Iteration is a essentially a loop through a function or program that will keep going through it until it meets the requirement not to repeat itself.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: For proper pair programming you have two roles.  One is the driver who has hands on the keyboard typing the code and using the text editor.  While the other role is navigator who is directing the driver by telling him what code to write or looking at the code already written and focusing entirely on that.  

Researched answer: The driver is behind the keyboard typing the coding while the navigator is focusing on the overal direction of the coding.  They help each other by discussing difficult code or solving issues together.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Higher order functions are functions that allow other functions to be in the parameters or even part of the returns in a function.

2. Jest: Jest is essentially the spell check for JavaScript and helps ensure the correctness of any codebase inside JavaScript.

3. Objects: Objects in Javascript are things that can standalone from anything else.  They do not need anything to define them.

4. Method: Methods seem to be a way to store functions inside an Objects properties which allows it to be used in unique ways.

5. Classes: Classes are like a blueprint for Objects in JavaScript.
